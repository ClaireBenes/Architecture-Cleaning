# Architecture Cleaning Class Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a clean and modular C++ architecture designed around the principles of clarity, ownership, and maintainability.  
The main focus areas include:
- Clear separation of responsibilities between components
- Smart pointerâ€“based memory management (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
- Avoiding singletons and global state
- Proper documentation and diagrams
